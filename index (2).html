                <p style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 22px; color: #008000; ">The history of computers dates back to ancient times when tools like the abacus were used for basic
                    calculations. Mechanical computing concepts
                    emerged in the 19th century with Charles Babbage’s design of the Analytical Engine, a programmable
                    machine ahead of its time. Although it was
                    never completed, it inspired future innovators. Alan Turing’s work in the 1930s laid theoretical
                    foundations for modern computers, introducing
                    the concept of algorithms and computation. These early efforts marked the beginning of humanity’s
                    quest to build machines capable of complex
                    problem-solving, setting the stage for rapid technological progress in the 20th century.</p>

                <p style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 22px; color: #FF4B33; text-align: right; ">The mid-20th century saw groundbreaking advancements with the development of electronic computers
                    like the ENIAC in 1945. This machine, designed
                    for high-speed calculations, was enormous and power-hungry but far more efficient than mechanical
                    predecessors. The invention of the transistor
                    in the 1950s revolutionized computers, making them smaller, faster, and more reliable. Programming
                    languages like FORTRAN and COBOL enabled
                    versatile applications, and computer systems became integral to industries such as finance and
                    research. These innovations not only enhanced
                    computational efficiency but also democratized access to technology, setting the foundation for
                    personal computing.</p>

                <p style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 22px; color: blue; text-align: left; ">The personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s brought computers into homes and offices. The
                    invention of microprocessors made devices
                    more compact and affordable. Companies like Apple and IBM introduced user-friendly machines like the
                    Apple II and IBM PC, while graphical
                    user interfaces (GUIs) simplified interaction. By the 1990s, the internet expanded the potential of
                    computers, connecting users worldwide.
                    Advances in hardware and software led to laptops, tablets, and smartphones, reshaping communication,
                    work, and entertainment. Today, computers
                    continue to evolve, driving innovation in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and other
                    cutting-edge fields.
